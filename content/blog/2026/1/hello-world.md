This is my first blog post and... I have no idea what to write.
<br><br>
I'm written many blog posts in my private Obsidian vault, planning for my website to be an online extension of it. But I realize now that writing that much is kinda TMI, and not very good for an online fingerprint or my safety. as such, I don't know what path I want my website to take now. I think I'll set up a private subdomain for blog posts, thought it does mean most blog post links will be unavalible to the general public.

On a side note, I am not in school right now. Because of extreme snow conditions this week, school from Monday to Wednesday was cancelled. A very, very good thing, because the workload of school is very overwhelming (Senioritis is very, very real). To pass the time, my family and I have made egg tarts and meringue cookies. They make for a great breakfast snack. I made a couple snowballs for the first time in years. Snow is very rare where I live because most winters, only ice appears.

I've also been drawing a lot more again, mostly out of neccessity. A bunch of Hack Club programs need me to get art finished ASAP... I have nobody to blame but myself for procrastinating and taking on such a high workload. Aside from Hack club art, I've been working on a commission for my awesome friend [Rowan](https://3kh0.net), who was originally supposed to pay me $0.67 cents and then dropped a $100 dollar bill on me. I won't speak on what I'll be using the funds for, as it endangers my safety, but my purchase will last me a long time and will make me very, very happy about myself. Thank you, Rowan.<br>

\[Content removed\]. Mostly consisted of complaining, I don't want that to be the first blog post. I must keep my head high, I have to get better. I mustn't give up so soon.
