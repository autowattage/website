    <h2>Professional jargon</h2>
    <p>Modified about-me from the <a href="https://hackclub.com/team">Hack Club team page</a>:</p>
    <q>Bunnyguy is a 17-year-old Viet-American artist and programmer based in the United States.<br>
       Bunnyguy has previously contributed art for Hack Club programs such as Counterspell, High Seas, and Summer of Making.</q>
    <p>Back in the summer of 2025, I interned at Hack Club to help organize <a href="https://undercity.hackclub.com/">Undercity</a>, a 4-day hardware hackathon hosted at GitHub HQ.</p>
    <h2>Cooler about-me</h2>
    <p>I don't have any pets, but I own and play with multiple beloved <a href="/tmgc/">Tamagotchi</a>.</p>
    <p>I'm especially a big fan of the games Mirror's Edge and Portal 2. They have completely altered my brain chemistry.</a>
