This is version 11 of my website, which introduces the new domain 'sundial.city'.

Everything is made with 11ty and raw html (rendered with nunjucks), css, and markdown (rendered with liquid).
The paper texture was made by scanning constrution paper and apply color filters (HSL adjustment) on krita!
