# Sundial city
you're on version 11 of my website, made for hack club's [page](https://page.hackclub.com) YSWS program.
the goal of sundial city is to:
- serve as a web-based personal digital assistant
- archive/track my life over time
- express myself
- become my strongest internet presence in lieu of social media

sundial city is made with 11ty and html (rendered as nunjucks), css, and markdown (rendered with liquid).
artwork, assets, and paper textures are made by scanning constrution paper and applying color filters (HSL adjustment) on krita.
