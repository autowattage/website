    <h2>Professional jargon</h2>
    <p>Modified about-me from the <a href="https://hackclub.com/team" target="_blank">Hack Club team page</a>:</p>
    <q>Bunnyguy is a 17-year-old Viet-American artist and programmer based in the United States.<br>
       Bunnyguy has previously contributed art for Hack Club programs such as Apocalypse, Counterspell, High Seas, and Summer of Making.</q>
    <p>Back in the summer of 2025, I interned at Hack Club to help organize <a href="https://undercity.hackclub.com/" target="_blank">Undercity</a>, a 4-day hardware hackathon hosted at GitHub HQ. I made a bunch of art assets, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water bottles</li>
      <li>Stickers</li>
      <li>Postcards</li>
      <li>Patches</li>
      <li>PCB (art)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Krita is my go-to drawing program, but I have experience using Adobe Animate, Blender, Figma, and 3DS Max.</p>
    <h2>Cooler about-me</h2>
    <p>Despite being Vietnamese, I have little fluency; English is my preferred language. For those who are into personality tests, my MBTI is INTP-T.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My favorite number is 153 and my favorite color is yellow. In my free time, I like to draw, study about computers, linux systems, and strange programming languages; occassionally play with hardware, and work on my website. I'd like to specialize in making human-centered robotics, as I find technology a beautiful art medium.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Though I rarely play video games nowadays, I'm especially a big fan of the games Mirror's Edge and Portal 2. Both these games have played a huge part in developing my sense of self.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I stumbled across Neocities back in my freshman year of high school. During animation class, my friend [Name removed for privacy] came up to my desk and introduced me to personal websites. I signed up for an account right on the spot and immediately started making my website.</p>

    <h2>Bunnyguy NOW!</h2>

      <li><span>Mood</span>: exhausted but in the best way possible</li>
      
      <li><span>Tamagotchi</span>: none</li>
      
      <li><span>Current song</span>: Don't Stop Me Now - Queen</li>
      
      <li><span>Current fixations</span>: none</li>
      
      <li><span>Current studies</span>: none</li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>Today is a snow day! School for the next two days is cancelled too, so I'm pretty hyped.</p><p>I've been quite sluggish this weekend. I think the snow and cold weather has got me feeling quite down, and parkour class got cancelled. I'll use this time to prepare, energize, etc.. instead.</p><p>I won't go too deep into detail, but today, using commission money kindly donated to me by <a href="https://3kh0.net">Rowan</a>, I took a leap of faith to buy something that'll make me pretty damn happy for a long time. But I have to work on my commission now LOL.</p>
