  <p>Today is a snow day! School for the next two days is cancelled too, so I'm pretty hyped.</p><p>I've been quite sluggish this weekend. I think the snow and cold weather has got me feeling quite down, and parkour class got cancelled. I'll use this time to prepare, energize, etc.. instead.</p><p>I won't go too deep into detail, but today, using commission money kindly donated to me by <a href="https://3kh0.net">Rowan</a>, I took a leap of faith to buy something that'll make me pretty damn happy for a long time. But I have to work on my commission now LOL.</p>

    <li><span>Mood</span>: sleepy and jittery</li>
    
    <li><span>Tamagotchi</span>: none (dead D:)</li>
    
    <li><span>Current song</span>: Ready to Fly - Masayoshi Takanaka</li>
    
    <li><span>Current fixations</span>: Alto's Adventure</li>

  </ul>

  <p>A lot of art assets I had to do got rescheduled to a few months in the future... a great weight has been lifted off my back, but it is only delayed to a future date.</p><p>So now i will just work on getting as many finished pages on my website.</p><p>Also renewed the bunnyguy.foo domain, just so broken links all around don't live forever. If you're still using that domain, please switch over to sundial.city! I won't be renewing it this year!</p>
